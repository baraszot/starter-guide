            <h1>Meet your friends more often</h1>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 40px;">That’s probably the best advice to give to anyone who’s lucky enough to have friends and family worthy of the term: see them as much as you can. (If you’re not there at the moment, I sincerely wish you that these studies will eventually lead to some serious friend-making.) You may need to say “Sorry, I’ve classes this weekend” more than once this year, so take initiative in creating opportunities to spend time with your close ones when you can. Ideally engage them in some physical activity as you’ll be missing out on that because of the classes as well. A hike in the forest or playing some sport will help you all rest and recharge. Also anything that makes you keep your eyes on the ball (literally) might be of extra benefit for screen-worn eyes and it usually requires other players (social bonus). From table tennis with your mum to back-garden football with your nephews – there are lot of things that are fun and don’t require great fitness or fancy equipment.</p>
            <p class="noteAlt">Don’t assume you need to have loads of fun with your friends to benefit from meeting them. We’re wired for connection and having friends is beneficial in many ways. In an episode of BBC 4 series <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000rvl6" title="BBC 4 The Spark">The Spark</a>, Noreena Hertz recounts an exciting meeting with a “rented” friend only to conclude with an obvious truth that is rarely acknowledged: spending time with your real friends is sometimes quite boring. But even that boring time is so much more valuable in the long term that the instant entertainment offered to us by our electronic devices. So just suffer through that dreary story they’re telling you, so that they’ll suffer through yours some other day.</p>
