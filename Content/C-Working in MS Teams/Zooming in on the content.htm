            <h1>Zooming in on the content</h1>
            <p class="table-text"><span class="span_1">For the practical parts of the classes, the instructor will often be sharing their screen (or ask a volunteer to share theirs) so that the group can see exactly what needs to be done in a given tool. Sometimes you may find it hard to see the content properly on your screen and staring at something that is simply too small to be looked at comfortably can be tiring. Luckily, there are ways to make these things bigger.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="table-text"><span class="span_1">Some tools, like internet browsers or Visual Studio Code allow their users to easily zoom in on the content. In those cases, the easiest way to fix your (and most probably other students’) problem is to <b>ask the instructor to zoom in on their end</b>. Keep in mind that the reason they are sharing their screen in the first place is for you to see what’s on it, so they will certainly try to accommodate any zooming requests that you may have. If the tool does not allow it so easily, they may use <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-magnifier-to-make-things-on-the-screen-easier-to-see-414948ba-8b1c-d3bd-8615-0e5e32204198">Magnifier</a>, an in-built Windows tool, that you may also use at your end.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="table-text"><span class="span_1">If you only need a slight enlargement, the <b>Focus on content</b> mode described in <a href="Hiding your video all videos.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Hiding your video/all videos from your view</a> may be sufficient. As it hides the incoming videos of other participants, the space that they occupy is used by the shared content. This, in consequence, makes the content bigger.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="table-text"><span class="span_1">Another option available at your end is <b>a zooming tool in Teams</b>. Simply look for a plus (and a minus) sign in the left bottom corner of the shared content window, next to the screen sharing person's name. These allow you to zoom in and out on the shared content. Once you use one of them, a third icon appears: this option will reset the image to its original size with one click.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="table-text">&#160;</p>
            <p class="noteAlt"><span class="span_1">The help authoring tools (HATs) such as MadCap Flare or Oxygen XML Author really have a lot of options and thus are not great for viewing as a shared content if your computer screen is small. If you’re only using one screen and switch from Teams to the studied tool, the challenge is even greater. Consider using a reasonably sized second monitor at least for the classes that deal with these tools. See <a href="../F-Additional devices/Second screen.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Second screen</a> for more details.</span>
