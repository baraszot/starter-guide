            <h1>Dealing with technical problems</h1>
            <p class="table-text"><span class="span_1">If you were asked to install a given tool before the class, please remember to do so. Also make sure any battery you will be depending on (your laptop, headphones, etc.) is adequately loaded. When learning a new tool, try to follow the instructions closely and alert the instructor if their pace is too fast. These are things you can and should do to avoid problems, but sooner or later something will probably go wrong. Don’t be shy to ask for help when that happens. Sometimes it might be enough to ask the instructor to repeat some step you missed, but often you will be asked to share your screen so that they can see what went wrong.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="noteAlt">Sharing your screen for troubleshooting may result in a sudden deterioration of your ability to do just about anything right for as long as everybody else can see what you’re doing. Don’t worry. Most of us have that problem. Just trust the process. It really works better than trying to explain what you see on your screen.</p>
            <p class="table-text"><span class="span_1">There are two main options of sharing your screen:</span>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can <b>share just one window</b> (the one where the problem occurred): this means nothing else on your computer will be visible to the rest of the group. This often seems a reasonable option, but keep in mind that some tools may open additional windows that you may also need to show (e.g. when generating a pdf or a website).</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="span_1">You can <b>share your whole screen</b>: this will allow you to easily switch the windows you are showing to the rest of your class. If you’ve been busy doing things unrelated to the class, using this option may accidentally reveal this to everyone. That is one good reason to refrain from any multitasking during the meeting. Moreover, research confirms that  <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2021/cao_remote/CHI2021-RemoteMeetingMultitask.pdf" title="Large Scale Analysis of Multitasking Behavior" alt="Large Scale Analysis of Multitasking Behavior">multitasking often leads to losing track of online meetings</a>.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <p class="noteAlt"><span class="span_1">Remember the good old days of in-class studies? How the teachers could not turn projectors on, no one could open or close the window, the copying of the handout went wrong and everybody had two page 3s and no page 4, none of the markers wrote and someone sneezed so loud that everybody laughed? Classes were always prone to be disrupted in some way. We just perceive it differently when we’re not all in the same room together. It can be nerve-racking to admit something is not working as expected on your end or you may be frustrated that other people’s problems are slowing you down, but give yourself, your teacher and your fellow students some grace. This is all a part of the shared learning experience.</span>
